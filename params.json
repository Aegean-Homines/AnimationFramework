  "body": "### Simple Anim Framework\r\nI created this Animation Framework as a part of our Animation class. It is nowhere near perfect and probably filled with bugs but it works fairly well and helped me with my animation assignments.\r\n\r\nPlease note that this is literally an amalgamation of code that helps me with what I want. It doesn't have a perfect architecture because I didn't spend time building any. You're looking at a 5 days worth of programming so don't expect to see the pinnacle of programming. You'll see some singletons, a few classes with just static variables and math. Lots and lots of math.\r\n\r\nI have working algorithms for FBX file reading, how to handle anim data you get from those files, how to store them and how to use them to have a fluent animation, how to interpolate between frames.\r\n\r\nAlso, I have spline path building and speed control of the animating model on that spline as well as how to handle timing.\r\n\r\nFinally, I added Inverse Kinematics to handle a simple model (6 nodes, only one end-effector) reaching to a cube you can move around (I think by holding spacebar and using the mouse).\r\n\r\nIt'll (hopefully) have a physics-based animation due next week as part of my final assignment.",
