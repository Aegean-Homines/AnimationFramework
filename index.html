<p>I created this Animation Framework as a part of our Animation class. It is nowhere near perfect and probably filled with bugs but it works fairly well and helped me with my animation assignments.</p>

<p>Please note that this is literally an amalgamation of code that helps me with what I want. It doesn't have a perfect architecture because I didn't spend time building any. You're looking at a 5 days worth of programming so don't expect to see the pinnacle of programming. You'll see some singletons, a few classes with just static variables and math. Lots and lots of math.</p>

<p>I have working algorithms for FBX file reading, how to handle anim data you get from those files, how to store them and how to use them to have a fluent animation, how to interpolate between frames.</p>

<p>Also, I have spline path building and speed control of the animating model on that spline as well as how to handle timing.</p>

<p>Finally, I added Inverse Kinematics to handle a simple model (6 nodes, only one end-effector) reaching to a cube you can move around (I think by holding spacebar and using the mouse).</p>

<p>It'll (hopefully) have a physics-based animation due next week as part of my final assignment.</p>
